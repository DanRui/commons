COMMONS
===
As the saying goes，don't repeat yourself.In order to avoid search the common code in google everytime,I try to build the COMMONS project of mine which include a series of common code.

#### There are some pionts of my initial goals：

+ the project includes simple and common code I use in my work.
+ It is easy to use that is as little as possible to rely on other jar package.
+ It is modular that you can just choose some module of it to use which you need. 

#### The main module of the COMMONS are as follows.

+ **install**:the parent pom module of the project
+ **cache**
+ **io**
+ **json**
+ **log**
+ **persistence**
+ **security**
+ **utils**
